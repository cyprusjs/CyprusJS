## Traffic Management Goal

The whole intention of the group is to get people to the events to share knowledge, socialize & network. So our goal is to have people to sign up or at least RVSP, letting the host of the event know, or at least give them a an indication, of how many attendees that will show up to the event.

**Eg.**

* User --> Landing page of CyprusJS (with the upcoming event(s) listed) --> Event Specific Page --> User Interaction with signing in how many Participants

* User --> Affiliated Site to CyprusJS (with the upcoming event listed) with a link to the Event Specific Page with RVSP --> Event Specific Page --> User Interaction on the page with RVSP function.
